# Mumbai Temperature Forecasting using ARIMA

This repository contains a time series analysis and temperature forecasting model for Mumbai using the ARIMA model.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project uses historical temperature data to build an **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** model. The model is trained to forecast future temperatures and visualize trends over time.

## 🧠 Model Used
- **ARIMA (p,d,q)** model
- ACF and PACF plots to determine the best parameters
- Model diagnostics and residual analysis

## 📊 Output
- Time series plots
- ACF/PACF graphs
- Forecasted values
- Model performance metrics (AIC, BIC, RMSE, etc.)

## 📁 Files in this Repository
- `mumbai-temperature-by-arima.ipynb` – The main Jupyter notebook with all analysis and code
- `README.md` – This file

## 🔧 Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
